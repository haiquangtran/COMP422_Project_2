	 * Choose two single feature ranking algorithms (e.g. Information Gain and Chi-square) and
	 * apply them to Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Sonar data sets. Choose a classifier (e.g na¨ıve
	 * Bayes) and a number n representing the desired number of selected features (e.g. 5). Do the
	 * following:
	 * 1. Compare the performance of the classifier using all the features vs n top ranked features
	 * from each method. Analyse your results.
	 * 2. Use a wrapper approach to select n features and then measure the performance of the
	 * classifier using the selected features. Compare the result with the filter (single-ranking)
	 * approach and analyse your findings.
